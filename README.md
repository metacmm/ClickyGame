# ClickyGame

## Introduction

Clicky Game is a React application where user's score is tracked. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. User's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. 

Top score is remembered and will be reset to current score if current score is higher.
